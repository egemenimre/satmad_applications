# How-to Guides

This section presents how-to guides for frequent problems of astrodynamics and satellite mission design, and
how to solve them with SatMAD.

The text-only Jupyter notebook versions of these analyses are at the [project repository](https://github.com/egemenimre/satmad_applications/tree/main/docs/how_to_guides). You can also try the interactive versions by clicking on the **launch binder** badges below each tutorial.
