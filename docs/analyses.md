# Analyses

This section presents analyses of real-world problems or mathematics, modelling or physics problems.

The text-only Jupyter notebook versions of these analyses are at the [project repository](https://github.com/egemenimre/satmad_applications/tree/main/docs/analyses). You can also try the interactive versions by clicking on the **launch binder** badges below each tutorial.
